# BPMN Best Practices (Camunda 7)
- Always use explicit start and end events.
- Name every task, event, and gateway for clarity.
- Avoid excessive use of parallel gateways; prefer event-based.
- Modularize processes using Call Activities and Sub-Processes.
- Document error/exception handling with boundary events and escalation paths.
